Anomaly detection algorithm with prediction-based technique is the problem in which many researchers in anomaly detection community have been interested. Because this is a new approach, taking advantage of the explosion of deep learning neural networks. This method consists of two main tasks: data prediction and anomaly detection. The data sets used for anomaly detection are the data sets that are widely used by researchers in anomaly detection, these data sets are time series, which are correlated with each other. To be able to accurately predict with correlated time series data, this thesis proposes a model using a stacked LSTM network. In addition to improving the forecasting ability, we also apply multi-step-ahead prediction for this model. Forecast error may be used for anomaly detection. To evaluate the model, we make a comparison with the HOTSAX algorithm on the anomaly detection results and execution time. Experimental results on 08 data sets show that our proposed model has overcome the limitation when relying on sliding window size in the HOTSAX algorithm, and also confirms the potential of anomaly detection algorithm with prediction-based technique.
